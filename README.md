## 😄 Hi there!😄
I'm Antonio Vélez, a 26-year-old Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the University of Cádiz and a lecturer at the same university.

### 🔙 My beginnings
I have always been related to computers. My father was also a programmer in the 80s when he used BASIC and Clipper. He also attended a Cobol course that never applied to his job. Then, he left the job and moved to the public administration. After that, he continued trying to code just for fun and learning C++, but he didn't achieve it and lost interest in coding.

At that time, access to information was difficult because of the lack of the Internet. However, his interest in informatics in general never stopped. He continued repairing PCs and installing operating systems, programs, etc.

I grew up in that context, so my interest in computing multiplied. I asked my father how the windows of Windows XP was made. He asked the Internet what was the best programming language to learn for a fourteen-year-old child. People recommended C/C++ and the Deitel&Deitel book. At fifteen, I started to learn coding just for fun with that book.

I signed up for a famous Spanish programming web forum, where I asked questions and helped other people solve problems. Some years later, I programmed my first UI using Qt and later using GTK2 libraries.

Then, I enrolled in university and learned about programming and best practices, data structures, software engineering, development methodologies, design patterns, quality assurance, requirements engineering, web engineering, patterns recognition, and much more. Next, I enrolled in an MSc. in research about Computer Science, Big Data, and Digital transformation. After that, I did what I do right now, my Ph.D. thesis about advanced artificial intelligence techniques to extract knowledge from bibliographic sources.
